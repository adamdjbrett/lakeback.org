information: Onondaga Lake is the birthplace of democracy, lacrosse, the women's
  rights movement, and more. This lake is the ancestral home of the Onondaga
  Nation and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. The United States agreed that the
  lake would always belong to the Onondaga Nation and the Haudenosaunee
  Confederacy with the 1794 Canandaigua treaty.
