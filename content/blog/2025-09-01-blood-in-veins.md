<blockquote>
When the Onondaga people stand on its shores and speak their language, Lyons says the lake responds; the fish leap from the water, the birds alight on the shores, the eagles circle overhead.

To the Onondagas, the lake and its ecosystem are not commodities or resources – they are living relatives.

“That water is like the blood in our veins,” Lyons said. “It’s who we are.”
