Our friends at [Neighbors of Onondaga Nation - NOON](https://peacecouncil.net/noon/home/) have made a super helpful map highlighting where Maple Bay is exactly along the lake. According to this map Maple Bay is on the northwest side of Onondaga Lake. This map is taken from the NOON website and used with permission.

We ask that you take a moment and write to the Onondaga County Executive and ask him to honor the County's committment to return a piece of the lake to Onondaga Nation.
