Our friends at [Neighbors of Onondaga Nation - NOON](https://peacecouncil.net/noon/home/) have made a suepr helpful map highlighting where Maple Bay is exactly along the lake. According to this map Maple Bay is on the northwest side of Onondaga Lake.

We ask that you take a moment and write to the Onondaga County Executive and ask him to honor the County's committment to return a piece of the lake to Onondaga Nation.
