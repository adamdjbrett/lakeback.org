<blockquote>
<p>Shortly before noon, Tadodaho (spiritual leader) Sid Hill and other representatives of the Onondaga Nation unfurled a 25-foot blue banner. Iridescent balloon weights were tied to the bottom to hold it down. In large white letters, it read:&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Return Maple Bay</em></p>
        <p><em>Indigenous Lands in Indigenous Hands</em></p>
        <p><em>#LakeBack</em></p>
    </blockquote>
<p>The canary yellow&nbsp;<em>Seneca Chief&nbsp;</em>emerged around the corner a few minutes later, flanked by a tugboat, several kayaks, and an entourage of followers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were cheering for our banner, which tells me something. Which gives me hope,&rdquo; said Betty Lyons Hill, the executive director of the American Indian Law Alliance and a citizen of the Onondaga Nation, after the ship had disappeared from sight.</p>
