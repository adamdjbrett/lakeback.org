### Onondaga Lake is a Relative, not a Resource

American Indian Law Alliance Founder Tonya Gonnella Frichner (Onondaga Nation, Snipe Clan) reminds us that Mother Earth is a [relative, not a resource](https://ictnews.org/archive/tonya-gonnella-frichner-mother-earth-is-a-relative-not-a-resource). Tragically- because of the Doctrine of Discovery- Onondaga Lake, the sacred lake of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy has been treated as a resource for extraction and pollution, not a relative to be in caring reciprocity with. This timelines uplifts various important dates that revolve around Onondaga Lake and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, which was founded at the shores of the lake. Ongweoweh (The Original People) and the lake have a long history of reciprocal caretaking extending far before European colonization. 

This timeline is a work in progress.
