### Onondaga Lake is a Relative, not a Resource

American Indian Law Alliance Founder Tonya Gonnella Frichner (Onondaga Nation, Snipe Clan) reminds us that Mother Earth is a [relative, not a resource](https://ictnews.org/archive/tonya-gonnella-frichner-mother-earth-is-a-relative-not-a-resource). Ongweoweh (The Original People) and the lake have a long history of reciprocal caretaking extending far before European colonization. 

Tragically- because of the Doctrine of Discovery- Onondaga Lake, the sacred lake of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, has been treated as a resource for extraction and pollution, not a relative to live in caring reciprocity with. 

This timeline is a work in progress, and uplifts various important dates related to Onondaga Lake and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, which was founded at the shores of the lake.
