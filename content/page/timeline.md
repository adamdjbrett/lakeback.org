### Onondaga Lake is a Relative, not a Resource

American Indian Law Alliance Founder Tonya Gonnella Frichner (Onondaga Nation, Snipe Clan) reminds us that Mother Earth is a [relative, not a resource](https://ictnews.org/archive/tonya-gonnella-frichner-mother-earth-is-a-relative-not-a-resource).

This timeline provides some snapshots of important moments in the history of Onondaga Lake.
