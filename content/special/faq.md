  q: What does a caretaking relationship mean for the Onondaga Nation?
  a: |
    The Onondaga Nation has a mandated responsibility to care for our relatives
    including the earth, waters, and all beings. This is not ownership but a
    relationship of reciprocal care.

    q: Why Maple Bay?
    a: Located on the northwest shore, Maple Bay is a great place to start with
      returning Onondaga lake to Onondaga nation because it is one of the least
      polluted parts of the lake. It is a quiet, relatively secluded spot where
      there are many plants and animals. As a protected and secluded part of the
      lake it provides some privacy for the people who gather there. Our sister
      organization NOON has made a wonderful map showing the location of Maple
      Bay.

    q: "What does #LakeBack mean?"
    a: "#Lakeback is a campaign to ensure that Maple Bay, on the shores of Onondaga
      Lake is returned to the Onondaga Nation. The County Legislature passed a
      resolution to return Maple Bay in a [2016
      resolution](/pdfs/Onondaga-land-transfer-committee-resolution-5-3-16.pdf),
      which replaced a previous County Legislature [resolution from
      2011](/pdfs/ongov-june-2011.pdf). Lake Back will restore the relationship
      between the Onondaga Nation and our sacred Onondaga Lake. This campaign
      grows from the global LandBack movement. Our sister organization [Honor
      the Earth says](https://www.honorearth.org/land-back), &ldquo;Land Back is
      a political movement of returning land to Indigenous people whose land and
      sovereignty were stolen by settler colonialism. With land at its core,
      Land Back is also about reclaiming our peoplehood, medicines, ceremonies,
      languages &amp; our futures. It is about fighting for a world in which we
      all live in right relationship with the environment and each
      other.&rdquo;"
