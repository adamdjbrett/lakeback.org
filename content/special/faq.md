  q: What does a caretaking relationship mean for the Onondaga Nation?
  a: |
    The Onondaga Nation has a mandated responsibility to care for our relatives
    including the earth, waters, and all beings. This is not ownership but a
    relationship of reciprocal care.

    q: "What does #LakeBack mean?"
    a: "#Lakeback is a campaign to ensure that Maple Bay, on the shores of Onondaga
      Lake is returned to the Onondaga Nation. The County Legislature passed a
      resolution to support the return of a piece of land on teh shores of Onondaga Lake in a [2016
      resolution](/pdfs/Onondaga-land-transfer-committee-resolution-5-3-16.pdf),
      which replaced a previous County Legislature [resolution from
      2011](/pdfs/ongov-june-2011.pdf). Lake Back will restore the relationship
      between the Onondaga Nation and our sacred Onondaga Lake. This campaign
      grows from the global LandBack movement. Our sister organization [Honor
      the Earth says](https://www.honorearth.org/land-back), &ldquo;Land Back is
      a political movement of returning land to Indigenous people whose land and
      sovereignty were stolen by settler colonialism. With land at its core,
      Land Back is also about reclaiming our peoplehood, medicines, ceremonies,
      languages &amp; our futures. It is about fighting for a world in which we
      all live in right relationship with the environment and each
      other.&rdquo;"

    q: Why Maple Bay?
    a: Located on the northwest shore, Maple Bay is a great place to start with
      returning Onondaga lake to Onondaga nation because it is one of the least
      polluted parts of the lake. It is a quiet, relatively secluded spot where
      there are many plants and animals. As a protected and secluded part of the
      lake it provides some privacy for the people who gather there. Our sister
      organization NOON has made a wonderful map showing the location of Maple
      Bay.

    q: What is the goal of the Lake Back campaign?
    a: "#LakeBack is a campaign to ensure that Maple Bay, on the shores of Onondaga
      Lake, is returned to the Onondaga Nation. The Onondaga County Legislature
      passed a resolution to return a piece of land on the shores of Onondaga
      Lake in a [2016 resolution](/pdfs/Onondaga-land-transfer-committee-resolution-5-3-16.pdf),
      which replaced a previous County Legislature [resolution from
      2011](/pdfs/ongov-june-2011.pdf) which also committed to a land return.
      Lake Back will restore the relationship between the Onondaga Nation and
      sacred Onondaga Lake."

    q: Why focus on Onondaga Lake?
    a: "The Onondaga Nation has a responsibility to care for all relatives, including
      the earth, waters, and all beings. This is not ownership but a relationship
      of reciprocal care. Onondaga Lake is deeply significant, as the birthplace
      of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, (which includes the Mohawk, Oneida,
      Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora Nations). This is where the Great
      Law of Peace was introduced, the basis of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy
      system of government. This is the world's oldest continuous democratic system."

    q: How does land return help clean up?
    a: "This land return will allow the original caretakers of Onondaga Lake to have
      a voice in the decision-making around the lake. The Onondaga Nation serves
      as a representative in discussions on the cleanup of the natural world and
      all living beings, especially as plants and animals are being ignored. The
      need for ongoing cleanup is disregarded, and instead, deeply unpopular
      projects such as the county-built aquarium on inlet to the Lake are
      prioritized."
  - sort: 7
    q: What will this land be used for when it is returned to the Onondaga Nation?
    a: "The Onondaga Nation intends to hold ceremonies and social gatherings at Maple
      Bay. Ceremonies returning to the shores of Onondaga Lake, the birthplace
      of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, are very significant and also an important
      part of healing Onondaga Lake. There is no intention to create commercial
      developments on the Lake as suggested in some circulating rumors."

    q: Why aren't Indigenous lands taxed?
    a: "This area has been Onondaga land for thousands of years, and continues to be
      Onondaga land. Most of Onondaga County, including the city of Syracuse,
      sits within the Onondaga Nation territory recognized in the 1794 Treaty of
      Canandaigua. Therefore, the Nation does not have to pay taxes on lands it
      is reacquiring.\n\nThere was no mention of taxes in the original resolution
      from the County Legislature in 2011 and 2016. The current Onondaga County
      Executive, Ryan McMahon, was the chair of the County Legislature at that
      time and voted in favor of the land return resolution. Yet now taxes are
      being raised as a tactic to prevent the land return."
  - sort: 9
    q: Why return Indigenous lands to Indigenous hands?
    a: "According to the U.S. Constitution, Article VI, treaties are the supreme law
      of the land. Honoring treaties is honoring the Constitution and being a good
      neighbor to Indigenous Nations. Indigenous Peoples are the original caretakers
      and recognized protectors of these lands under the treaties. We can all
      appreciate how traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) can help us better
      understand how to clean up and care for the lake."
  - sort: 10
    q: "I thought there was a treaty about the lake? Isn't the lake covered by the treaty?"
    a: "Yes, the [1794 Treaty of Canandaigua](/issues/canandaigua-treaty-of-1794/)
      is still in effect, and the county is in violation of it. According to the
      treaty, the lake and the land around it belong to the Onondaga Nation. In
      light of this major treaty violation, a small portion of the lake returned
      is the least the county can do."
  - sort: 11
    q: What are some good examples of Land Back?
    a: "There are many examples of land being returned to Indigenous Nations that are
      happening all around Turtle Island [the 'United States' and 'Canada'] but
      perhaps the most exciting one in our area is the return of over 1,000 acres
      of land to [Onondaga Nation](https://www.onondaganation.org/news/2024/onondaga-nation-plans-a-wild-future-for-1000-acres-of-reclaimed-land/)
      which took place in October 2024."

      organizations, businesses, and individuals. Contact us if you're interested
      in becoming more actively involved. Also, you can join our email list!"
