title: Two Wampum Treaty Agreed to Between the Haudenosaunee and the Dutch
description: Gaswéñdah, the Two Row Wampum Treaty, was the first treaty
  agreement made between the Haudenosaunee Confederacy of Nations and a European
  government. This treaty is part of a long history of treaties embodied in
  wampum belts, and is the basis for all other treaty agreements between the
  Haudenosaunee and Europeans. This treaty affirmed that the Dutch and the
  Haudenosaunee were brothers traveling down the river of life together in peace
  forever- one in their ship and the other in their canoe- and that they would
  not step into one another’s vessel to disrupt it. The Treaty of Canandaigua
  (see 1794 on timeline below) made with George Washington build from the
  agreements of the Two Row Wampum.
