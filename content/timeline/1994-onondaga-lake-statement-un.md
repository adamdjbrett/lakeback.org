title: Onondaga Lake Listed as a Superfund Site by the US Environmental
  Protection Agency
description: >-
  In 1994, Onondaga Lake was officially listed as a Superfund Site by the United
  States Environmental Protection Agency. This was the result of over a hundred
  years of pollution and desecration of the lake, as discussed above, years
  1884-1986.


  For background, in 1980 the U.S. Congress established the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), informally referred to as Superfund. This allows EPA to clean up contaminated places and forces the responsible polluters to perform the cleanup or pay the U.S. government for EPA-led cleanup work. See 2024 on the timeline below.
