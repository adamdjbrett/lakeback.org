title: George Washington orders Generals Sullivan and Clinton to Enact Genocidal
  “Scorched Earth”  Campaign
description: " During the American Revolutionary War, Haudenosaunee Nation
  remained neutral. In spite of this, General George Washington ordered
  Continental Army troops to attack Ongweoweh villages, burning their homes and
  gardens, and destroying their orchards. Many people fled from the oncoming
  assault, forced to abandon their communities and lands. Much of the land was
  then given as payment to Continental Army soldiers as a reward for their
  service. Because of this, the Haudenosaunee’s title for all US Presidents is
  Hanadagá•yas- Town Destroyer. You can learn more at
