title: In Historic Land Return, Onondaga Nation Regains Over 1,000 Acres of
  Ancestral Land
description: >
  The Onondaga Nation has regains over 1,000 acres (405 hectares) of its
  ancestral land. The forested land in the Tully Valley is near the Onondaga
  Nation territory. The land includes headwaters of Onondaga Creek. The land was
  transferred by Honeywell International under a federal Superfund settlement
  related to industrial contamination, see 1994 on the timeline above. 


  This land is part of an expanse of 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) that was illegally taken over decades by New York State, beginning in 1788. The land was taken through illegal maneuvers that violated nation-to-nation treaties as well as U.S. federal law.
