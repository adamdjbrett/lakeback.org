### About
Adam DJ Brett emphasizes the critical importance for scholars to own their online presence. Having a personal domain name, such as "FirstNameLastName.com," establishes authority and provides a stable foundation for an academic's digital identity. Unlike social media platforms, a custom domain offers control and permanence.

### Digital Artist
A well-designed website serves as a digital portfolio, showcasing a scholar's CV, publications, and teaching resources. It centralizes information and makes it accessible to diverse audiences1. For academics in fields like history or religious studies, a self-owned website allows for nuanced presentations of complex ideas.

By owning and managing their website, scholars ensure full control over content and design, avoiding dependency on external platforms that might introduce ads or unrelated distractions.
