title: Sacred Onondaga Lake becomes one of the most polluted lakes of Turtle Island
description: >-
  Over more than 100 years, sacred Onondaga Lake was completely desecrated. As
  the city of Syracuse grew, natural landscapes and plants were removed. Raw,
  untreated sewage was sent directly to the lake. Even when treatment started,
  it was insufficient. From the Onondaga Environmental Institute website: 

  “The largest industrial input to the lake came from Solvay Process chemical manufacturing facility (later named Allied Signal and Allied Chemical Co., and now owned by Honeywell International Inc.). During more than a century of operation (1884-1986), the western shore of the lake was inundated with more than 30 chemicals including insoluble sodium, calcium, and chloride waste generated from the soda ash production.”
